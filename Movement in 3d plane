# Movement in 3d tutorial 

how to make a 3d character move on the x and z axis in a 3d plane

# 1. create a new scene

in the hierachy right-click add 3 3d objects: a 3d plane,a cube and a capsule 

in the project right-click to create a new folder called scripts and open it up

double-click the folder and right-click again and create a c# script and immediately name it 'PlayerMovement' (if you dont name it straight away it will automatically name the code'NewBehaviour' as well as setting the class to the name causing problems with the 
programa ability to be recognise the code)

# 2. creating the code

double-clich the 'PLayerMovement' script and it will automatically open the script in visual studios(VS)

first you need to create 3 floats one for speed of movement,one for horizontal movements and one for forward and backwards movements

public float speed = 5.0f; <--- this one is made public so that we can manually change it from unity instead of having to go backwards and forwards from VS and unity
private float HorizontalInput;
private float ForwardInput;

(note a flaot is used by the engine to store floating point nuber values, these being mom-fixed numbers that chaged based on the rest of the code)

under void update firstly we need to define what the float do by telling them that when inputting a direction on the keyboard 

 HorizontalInput = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
 ForwardInput = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");
