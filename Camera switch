//simple guide on switch between two different camera angles

in the hierarchy make sure you have 2 cameras

1. code
create a new c# script in the projects tab

public GameObject Camera_1;
public GameObject Camera_2;
public int Manager;               ( unflexible number that we called manager)

define two voids

void Cam_1()
{
Camera_1.SetActive(true);
Camera_2.SetActive(false);
}
this means if camera 1 is on 2 isnt
void Cam_1()
{
Camera_2.SetActive(true);
Camera_1.SetActive(false);
}
this means the same as the other one but opposite way round

leave 1 space after public int manager; and add

public void ManageCamera()
{
if(Manager == 0)                     if manager is equal to 0 go to cam 2
{
cam_2();
Manager = 1;
}
else
{
cam_1();
Manager = 0;
}
save and go back to unity 

create empty in hierarchy and give code to it

assign the first and second camera

2. create a button

insert image into project call it button size and add texture to your liking

go back into code and after public int manager; add:

public void change camera()
{
GetComponent<Animator>().SetTrigger("Change");
}
